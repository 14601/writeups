This subdirectory contains some scripts I wrote for a particular day of the month for [hackvent 2015](http://hackvent.hacking-lab.com). Overall it was a great CTF. I ended up at #26 in 1000+ players.

* 18 Dec : Mach-O 64-bit x86_64 executable
* 19 Dec : Simple [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)
* 23 Dec : Format String Exploitation
